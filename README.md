# Adventure Game

A simple text-based adventure game built in Java as a console application. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts including class design, maps, user input handling, and control flow.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- The player starts at a default location (Road).
- Each location has a description and possible directions to move (North, South, East, West).
- The player can type a direction (N, S, E, W) to move, or type `Q` to quit the game.
- Invalid directions are handled with error messages.

│       └── Main.java          // Entry point to run the game
├── bin/                       // Compiled class files
├── .classpath, .project       // Eclipse IDE config files
└── README.md                  // Project overview (this file)
```
